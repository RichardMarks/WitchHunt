# Game Environment of WiTCHHUNT

The story takes place on the World of Ael. _(pronounced Ale as in the alcoholic beverage)_

Ael is a medium sized planet where the landmass has been divided into two continents by a vast ocean.

+ Windsor
+ Falsor

## The Windsor Continent

The terrain of the Windsor Continent varies from swamps to deserts and forest.

Largely inhabited by the humans of Ael.

### Locations of Windsor

+ Zular Swampland
+ Balmant Desert
+ Radnine Crag
+ Murias
+ Jindar Forest
+ Tomb of Knowledge
+ Hunter's Hideout
+ Hollis
+ Hiram
+ Underworld
+ Towers of Ginath

### Zular

Zular is a small village found deep within the Zular Swamplands.
The people of this village have divided their land into West Zular and East Zular,
with the markets and council in East Zular, and the homes found in the West part of town.

The village homes are mostly set on top of tall pilings above dark murky water.
There are tall trees throughout the village. In the center of the village is a
large floating landmass on which a statue of the village elders can be seen.
The city is built upon this landmass, and there is a short wooden bridge that
connects the landmass with the mainland.

### Balmant Desert

The Balmant desert covers most of the Windsor continent's southwest.

While mostly sand dunes and deadly quick sand pits, there are a few places of interest.
Most notably are the Radnine Crag and Town of Murias.

Just south of East Zular after about 10 miles of sand, the Radnine Crag can be found.
About 100 miles south of the Crag, you will find the large town of Murias.

### Radnine Crag

Originally the site of a temple of a long forgotten tribe known as the Radnine,
all that remains of this once large structure are the maze-like walls made of
a red-colored stone and dried up moats which surrounded and passed through the base
of the temple.

The 'Crag' as it has come to be known, is a series of treacherous maze-like
ravines and rocky formations in which many travelers have lost their way and perished.

There are many rockslides and deadly pits throughout the Radnine Crag, skeletons of
fallen adventurers litter the sandy rocks in nearly every corner.

### Murias

Murias is a large town located in the southwestern Balmant Desert.
The town is mostly deserted due to an increase in hostile creature appearances,
with a large cathedral in the southeastern part of town where many of the townspeople
have fled to for shelter from the savage beasts that now roam the streets at night.

The homes and buildings are built of large sandstones and tree branches cut from Jindar Forest.

### Jindar Forest

The great forests of Jindar covers the east and southeast of the Windsor continent.

Tall, densely-packed trees fill the forest. A river flows through the western portion
of the forest, and the entrance to the Tomb of Knowledge can be found near the center of
the forest in a small clearing to the south. The Hunter's Hideout is located far to the
southeast.

There are a few old trails mostly overgrown and rarely walked by humans in
hundreds of years that pass through the forest.

### Tomb of Knowledge

Not much is known about this tomb, except that there exists a great many tomes of the ancestral tribes
of legend and powerful forces keep anyone from entering the tomb.

Legend has it that deep within the catacombs and twisted caverns of the tomb, one
can find the gateway to the Underworld.

The tomb consists of seven levels, or floors if you will, each containing many
dead-ends and seemingly endless mazes. The walls are partly dirt and rock,
and some places there are ruined walls covered in hieroglyphic writings.

### Hunter's Hideout

The Hunter's Hideout is a long since abandoned shack made of cut tree limbs.
Roughly the size of a typical home, the shack has a single window and door.

The inside of the shack is littered with scrolls, books, and various weapons.

> The Hunters are a group of people who have vowed to protect the people of Ael, and hunt down and destroy the evil which threatens all of mankind.

### Hollis

Hollis is a mountainous location in the northeast of the Windsor continent.
There are several concentric rings of mountains in this land.
The city of Hiram can be found inside the innermost ring of mountains.

### Hiram

The Grand City of Hiram, once a massive palace of old kings, made around and
through the small mountain in the center of the land of Hollis, now an imperial
city where the richest people of Ael can be found.

Everything is built of a beautiful white stone material which is found in the mountains of Hollis.
The gates are made to keep anyone and anything from entering the palace.
Massive mechanisms control the gates from inside the walls of the city.

Hundreds upon hundreds of buildings and homes are built upon and around the
nearly-intact ruins of the palace.

### Underworld

Essentially this is Hell. The demonic beasts which are found on the Falsor continent
come from this place, and no human has ever traveled to the Underworld and returned.

### Towers of Ginath

Two ruined towers, once places of magic study and strategic planning for the
grand mages of Ginath, found west of Hollis in the center of Lake Windsor.

Black and red stones covered in ancient glyphs and battered by the weather of
more than a thousand years, these two towers no longer have the upper levels intact
and many pieces of the towers are broken.

The entrances to the towers are deep underneath the waters of Lake Windsor, which
once was dry and barren and held a great city, the city of Ginath.

## The Falsor Continent

Falsor is a place inhabited by demonic beings and features massive active volcanos and mostly barren rocky terrain.

*Gameplay does not take place on this continent, and is only mentioned in the story.*
