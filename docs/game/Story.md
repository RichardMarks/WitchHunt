HERO'S HOME - INTERIOR - VERY DARK BEDROOM

Unaware of your surroundings; You lie there, still, peaceful.
Silently dreaming of the many wonders of the world. Suddenly,
you are awakened by a blood-curdling scream emanating from
outside the window of your moon-lit bedroom.

As you grasp frantically for your striking stones to light the
delicate wick of the short candle at your bedside, you begin
to hear voices and another scream. This scream was not as the
last, for this one was not even human. Striking the stones
together causes a blinding flash and floods your room with
white light temporarily.

A familiar smell wafts through the air as the oils in the wick
ignite from the striking stone's hot sparks.
You have more light now, though your sight has not yet
adjusted to the change in brightness. You half-blindedly
stumble across your room and gather your few things, then make
your way to the door.

Cautiously you turn the key in the rusted lock, and the door
slowly creaks open. The rest of your home is dark, and the
light from your candle is not enough to cast away the many
shadows that surround you.

You feel a slight chill as a cool breeze blows across your
naked feet, and you soon realize that the door to your home
has been left wide open...

HERO'S HOME / WEST ZULAR STREET - EXTERIOR - FOGGY NIGHT

Stepping from the doorway, the rotted wooden boards creaking
underneath your feet with every step, you make your way to the
street and stand there frozen in place at the sight before you.

A young woman's body falls limp as some figure steps away
from her. A man races towards the figure from behind you,
nearly running into you as he passes.

Raising his hands to the heavens he speaks several words
in a foreign tongue and a white light emanates from
his palms and seem to pierce through the dark figure,
temporarily stunning it. You feel the hairs on the back of
your neck raise as the figure reaches out to the man quickly
advancing on him, lets out a violent scream that shatters
the unusally silent night and viciously attacks the man.

Your presence does not go unnoticed and the dark figure
begins to move towards you. You feel as if in a trance;
Unable to move, you feel the figure staring at you, his
dark gaze seems to have power over you.

The figure has become more clear to you now, as he slowly
makes his way over to you... Those black eyes; A Vampire!

You try to close your eyes, but feel as if you have no
control over your own body. The man shouts another word,
and as the Vampire closes in on your helpless body,
it screams once more and vanishes.

The man walks over to you, and introduces himself as Edgar
and tells you of the dangers of being outside during
the Dawn of the Blood. The young woman that lies there
in the street, suddenly rises to her feet and attacks
Edgar. He decapitates her and then falls to the ground,
lifeless, all of his life energy had been drained from him.

Horrified, you turn around to run from the gruesome scene
and are caught by surprise as the Vampire stands before
you. You are bitten and close your eyes as everything
turns to darkness....


ZULAR INN - INTERIOR - GUEST ROOM

Innkeeper:
"You're awake I see."

HERO:
"Huh? ... Where am I?"

Innkeeper:
"You are in the Zular Inn my friend."

HERO:
"... ... ugh ... what a horrible nightmare ..."

Innkeeper:
"My wife found you in the street unconcious about 4 days ago.
She pleaded with me to let you stay here.
Of course I agreed. She has been keeping a watchful eye on you."

HERO:
"Four days! I've been asleep for four days?"

Innkeeper:
"Arlia has been worried that you might not wake up.
And has been tending to you day and night. I sent her home
this morning, she was feeling ill. Probably from the lack of
rest. How are you feeling?"

HERO:
"I feel alright, a little tired, but other than that, I'm fine."

Innkeeper:
"Please, don't take this the wrong way, but If you are feeling
well enough, I must ask that you head home. I need the space for
paying customers."

HERO:
"Haha, Of course my good man. Thank you, for your hospitality."


HERO'S HOME - EXTERIOR / INTERIOR - BLAZING HOT DAYLIGHT
(Hero has just stepped inside his front door, the front door wide open)

You start feeling a little dizzy, and remember that there are
supplies in the [Shed] left over from when your lovely wife
[Darla] had sprained her ankle in the forest [East] of
your home.

HERO'S SHED - EXTERIOR - BLAZING HOT DAYLIGHT

Stepping up to the wooden door of the small [Shed], you pull
on the rusted handle with all your might. The door does not
budge. You look around the area and notice an axe nearby.
Taking the axe and destroying the door to the [Shed] you step
inside.

HERO'S SHED - INTERIOR - POOR LIGHTING
(Shed is lit from the open doorway and cracks between boards)

The inside of the [Shed] is very poorly lit and smells of many
herbs. Ahh how you used to love drinking Herbal Tea with
[Darla]. You see a small medical supply case on the bench.
You decide that it would be a good idea to take it with you.
There are a few old sealed bottles of Herbal Tea on a shelf
above the bench. You place a few of them in a burlap sack that
you found on the floor of the [Shed].

You turn to leave the [Shed] and you spot a silver Amulet
hanging near the entrance.  Taking the Amulet, you remember
the man who gave you the relic...

HERO:
"Brother Friel!"
"If anyone would know of a way to help me, it would be him!"
"Now if only I could remember where he would stay this time"
"of year..."
"Ohh yeah, [Brother Friel] should be at the [Church] in"
"[Murias]!"
"[Murias] is not too far [South] of [Zular]."
"It is starting to get dark, I had better get moving."


MURIAS - EXTERIOR / INTERIOR - MASSIVE CATHEDRAL

As you are walking up the large, smooth, granite steps of the
[Church], you can smell the incense and candles that are
burning inside. Entering the antechamber you notice that a
ceremony had recently taken place, and see a man clothed in
white kneeling in prayer across the way.
You walk over to the man and quietly speak to him.

HERO:
"[Brother Friel]..."

Brother Friel:
"A long time has past since we have spoken my friend, what"
"brings you to [Murias]?"

HERO:
"I'm afraid my visit is not is not a pleasant one."
"Let me explain..."

...explanation...

"...and so that is the reason I have come to [Murias],"
"to seek your aid."

Brother Friel:
"Indeed a truly disturbing tale HERO"
"! Show me the mark. I"
"will do what I can."

HERO:
"I feel a burning sensation in the sunlight."

Brother Friel:
"I see, come, we must seek the knowledge of the ancient"
"texts."

MURIAS - INTERIOR - UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS

[Brother Friel] leads you through the [Church] and down an
old stone spiral staircase to the [Catacombs] beneath the
[Church]. The halls are lit with a calming blue light, that
seems to come out of nowhere. You arrive at a large door
that [Brother Friel] opens with a small brass key.

Brother Friel:
"The [Forgotten Library]. A tomb of many tomes written by"
"the elder clerics."

HERO:
"I see, and the cure is to be found here?"

Brother Friel:
"I wish it were that easy, HERO."
"Alas, I must have some time to find a cure."

(Hero falls asleep against a stack of ancient books / stone wall)

MURIAS - INTERIOR - UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS

You awaken at the clattering of books falling to the ground.

HERO:
"[Brother Friel]?"

Brother Friel:
"Ah, HERO"
", I have found something"
"that may prove to be useful to you."

HERO:
"The cure?"

Brother Friel:
"This tome speaks of a [Scroll] of healing concoctions."

HERO:
"And the cure is listed on this scroll?"

Brother Friel:
"A bit impatient today aren't we, HERO?"

HERO:
"You would be too!"

Brother Friel:
"Listen to me HERO"
", you must find"
"this scroll and return to me."

HERO:
"How am I to find this scroll?"

Brother Friel:
"Head [East] of [Murias] to the [Jindar Forest]."
"Search the forest for a stone structure."
"You will find the entrance to a [Tomb] holding many"
"ancient scrolls. You should be able to find the scroll"
"in the tomb."
"Look for a [Scroll] bearing the seal of this ring."

The cleric hands you a ring with a strange symbol on it.

(The symbol on the ring is the Gate of Solomon)

HERO:
"I shall depart at once. Thank you for your help."
"I shall return."

HERO:
"Damn! I must be missing something!"

(Hero heads off on a quest for a gem that grants access to the tomb)

JINDAR FOREST - EXTERIOR - FACING THE TOMB ENTRANCE DUSK

You approach the hauntingly familiar archway of the
[Tomb of Knowledge] and feel a chill down your spine as
several hundred bats fly across the black sky overhead.
You can feel the presence of someone nearby. Ignoring
your inner fears you walk inside the tomb.
You can hear an errie chanting in the distance...

TOMB OF KNOWLEDGE - INTERIOR - GRAND ANTECHAMBER

You see an altar on the far side of the antechamber, you
carefully make your way across the room filled with the
decayed bodies of this forgotten cult.
As you reach the altar, you are attacked...

(Hero is attacked by two hell hounds and a bloody robed demon named Lupinus)
(Lupinus retreats after the hounds are killed)

After slaying the beasts, you approach the altar once more,
and find the [Scroll] bearing a seal matching your ring.
You take the [Scroll] and turn to leave the tomb...

You drop to your knees as all the bodies that filled the
antechamber are ...... gone!?

You hurry across the room, and run down the halls towards
the entrance. You can hear hundreds of footsteps behind you,
and the errie dark chanting continues to grow louder...

Just as you reach the tomb's entrance, you are attacked!

(Hero is attacked by hundreds reanimated corpses)

You fight your way through the hordes of undead that block
your path to the exit...

JINDAR FOREST - EXTERIOR - HEAVILY WOODED MIDNIGHT

You take the risk to rush through the undead denizens and
quickly increase the distance between you and the tomb.

HERO:
"*pant* *pant* I... must ... return *gasp* to [Brother Friel]!"

MURIAS CATHEDRAL - INTERIOR - ANTECHAMBER

Reaching the [Church], you race up the steps into the
antechamber...

Brother Friel:
"HERO! Have you found the [Scroll]?"

HERO:
"I have it here. There is something I must tell you about"
"the [Tomb of Knowledge]."

Brother Friel:
"You were attacked by the dead sprits of the forgotten."

HERO:
"H..How .... could you have known?"

Brother Friel:
"Hell's gate has been opened, there are legions of"
"demons walking the earth as we speak."
"Give me the [Scroll]."

HERO:
"... ... ..."

Brother Friel:
"Alas, I cannot translate all of these inscriptions but"
"there is one who I believe can help."

HERO:
"Tell me, how did you know I was attacked in the tomb?"

Brother Friel:
"I was watching. Remember, I'm not only a cleric my boy."
"I am an alchemist."

HERO:
"Alchemy! Of course! You used a sight spell,"
"heh I thought I was being watched."
"So, what is going on?"

Brother Friel:
"There is a dark soul conjuring spirits and raising the"
"dead in these lands. You must make haste!"

HERO:
"Undead, demons, dark souls... ... ... Wait, haste!?"
"Where am I going!?"

Brother Friel:
"You must seek the help of [Forlis Hungraz]."
"A master of the forgotten tongue."
"He should be able to help translate the [Scroll]."
"Hurry now, I shall be waiting for you."

HERO:
"Where am I to find this [Forlis Hungraz]?"

Brother Friel:
"You must go to [Hiram]. Far [North] of [Jindar]."
