# WiTCHHUNT, The Dawn of the Blood

WiTCHHUNT was originally developed for the Lilith's Enticement contest on RPGDX.net in 2007 and won 2nd place.
See docs/CONTEST.md for details

A supernatural gothic text based role playing game originally developed in a mix of C and C++.
The original source for this game is in the devcpp_old branch of this repository.

This revival port of the project is being started in order to bring the game to a wider audience (macOS, Linux) as it was originally build for running in a Windows 32-bit console.

## Changes to the original

### Target platform

The fundamental difference between the original and this project is going to be the change from a Windows 32-bit console application project to a fully cross-platform graphics based platform.

This does not mean that the game will not be text-based, but that the method of delivering the game content is changing from a plain console application to a more modern approach utilizing font rendering.

### Architecture

The original game architecture was rushed through 12 to 15 hours a day, for 6 days a week, across a span of 2 months by two highly inexperienced programmers both just learning the language, and how to build software that was more complicated than simple tutorials provided.

The entire architecture of the game will be engineered from the ground up in order to deliver the best user experience.

### Content

The original content of the game was cut short due to time constraints.

The cut content is going to be re-evaluated and possibly extended and/or rewritten to provide a better game experience.

### Controls

The original battle system was far from optimal in the execution and was the biggest negative of playing the game.

A new battle system will be developed for this project to help ensure the avoidance of stale gameplay.
